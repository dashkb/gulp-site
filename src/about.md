## What Am I?

<span class="lead">
I live in San Francisco, where I write code, play guitar,
and wrangle cats. I'm dedicated to consistently improving all of my skills; I find
my practice techniques are least effective on cats.
You can always recognize me by the palm tree (and pause to imagine yourself on a calm, sunny beach.)
